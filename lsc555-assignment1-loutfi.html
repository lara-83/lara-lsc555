<h3>System Introduction</h3>
<h4>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">The Waltham public library has been serving the general public of Waltham, Massachusetts since 1865, then known as the Free Town Library. Today, the WPL website, available in over a hundred languages, has several features and links for users stemming from all backgrounds and social groups. Their goal is to help local residents, all from different backgrounds and social groups, gain access to information and resources through various library services.</p>
</h4> 

<h3>Users</h3>
<h4>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">While the main patrons of the WPL are the general public, librarians primarily serve their local residents including children, teens, students, the elderly, the disabled, and immigrants as well as the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities. Those who use the services provided are often researchers, professionals, literary enthusiasts, or general information seekers.</p>
</h4> 

<h3>Content and Collections</h3>
<h4>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Apart from the traditional library catalog of books, movies, and music, the WPL contains several online resources for its users organized by subject. These include language and legal resources as well as general research and learning websites. Some of these resources are marked with one asterisk, indicating that it is limited to residents of Waltham, or two noting restrictions to on-site access only. There are also several programs, events, and services displayed on the homepage.</p>
</h4> 

<h3>Special Features</h3> 
<h4>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">One of the cool additions I noticed included access to discounted museum passes made available to Waltham residents. The WPL also created a Site Map that gives user the full layout of their website that also includes a “How do I…” tab that answers questions like how to get a library card or book a study room. Another amazing feature is their language learning page where they offer classes, digital learning tools, and resources on how to obtain citizenship.</p>

<h3> 
<p style="margin-left:15%;">Cons</p> 
</h3>
<h4>
<ul style="margin-left:18%; list-style-type:circle;">
	<li>Lack of immediete user interaction</li>
	<li>Some resources require a library card or proof of residency</li>
	<li>Specific links might take a bit of time to redirect users to seperate pages</li> 
</ul>
</h4> 

<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<h4>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">My main recommendation for the WPL would be to input a chat feature for reference questions. This could allow for users to receive immediate answers to research questions or other questions that might not be in the “FAQs” or “How do I...” tabs.</p>
