<h3>Heuristic Review</h3>
<h4>
<p>For the purposes of this review, I chose to focus on the topic of "Theatre" for undergraduate students to conduct research on.</p>
<dl style="margin-right:40%; padding-bottom:5pt;">
	<dt>1) Visibility of System Status</dt>
	<dd>The titles at the top of the homepage shows the user where they are within the website with a white line under the tab. There is also grey text displayed underneath it indicating how the user got to each page, allowing them to click on a previous location and reroute back to that page.  However the one flaw with this design is that when you click on an article, the locations change according to the date the article was published.</dd>

	<dt>2) Match Between the System and the Real World</dt>
	<dd>Different subjects, titles, dates, and icons linked on the website are easily recognizable and effectively show what the output will be. There are no unfamiliar jargon words or icons that a student would not be able to understand as a search bar or scrolling arrows. If my students want to search for articles on theatre performances, they would know to look under the "Arts & Entertainment" tab or see the search function to look up specific performances.</dd>

	<dt>3) User Control and Freedom</dt> 
	<dd>Apart from the back button already available on any device, there is not any obvious way to undo an action on the website except for reclicking on your previous location. A user does however, have the option to use the links at the top of the page The only feature resembling this is at the bottom of articles, where a user can choose to go to the previous or next article chronologically.</dd>

	<dt>4) Consistency and Standards</dt>
	<dd>The website itself is structured like any other digital news outlet available, with features such as a title that is hyperlinked to the homepage as well as a menu bar that displays different tabs of topics and links which remains consistent on top of the page as users navigate the site.</dd>

	<dt>5) Error Prevention</dt>
	<dd>While the website does use a lot of color and graphics to indicate where everything is and when a cursor is hovering over a tab or article title, there are not that many features in place to prevent user errors.</dd>

	<dt>6) Recognition Rather than Recall</dt>
	<dd>With the menu bar and previous links consistently and conveniently displayed at the top of every page, students can simply reference these tools when they need them. The site also provides users with red boxes above every article title that act as tags to show which topics the article can be found under.</dd>

	<dt>7) Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</dt>
	<dd>One piece of evidence I saw of this is an arrow button that appears once you start scrolling, allowing the user to retun to the top of the page whenever they need to. There are also features that are available in multiple places like the search function, the archives, and the menu bar.</dd>

	<dt>8) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</dt>
	<dd>The design of the website is where it begins to fall short as the starting page can appear overwhelming with revolving flash stories and the unnessesarily large title font. Yet this format is often standard for a news outlet. However, one main drawback is the Archives displaying as one long list that is not collapsable and adds significant and distracting white space to the middle of every page. </dd>

	<dt>9) Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</dt>
	<dd>There are a couple of ways the Tower shows users that an action is not able to be done. For example, if a student is looking up the name of a production that had not been reported on, the page will display "Nothing Found" and prompt the user to change their keywords to find more results. The text under the menu bar displaying the links that brought them to this specific page also give the user an option to return back to a previous page if what they clicked on did not provide them with the information they needed or perhaps wanted.</dd>

	<dt>10) Help and Documentation</dt>
	<dd>The Tower website does not have any type of help service implemented for their users nor does it state anywhere where to get help navigating the website if it is required.</dd>

<h3>
<p>Top 2 Strengths</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<ol style="margin-right: 40%;">
	<li>The menu and search bars that remain consistent throughout navigating the website is a helpful research tool</li>
	<li>Having your previously visited links displayed at the top of the page can assist in recall while searching for articles</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<p>Top 2 Weaknesses</p>
</h3> 
<h4>
<ol>
	<li>The list of "Archives" on the right side is not collapsable and adds a lot of unncessesary white space to every page</li>
	<li>Searching for articles within the "Archives" can be difficult as they are not organized according to topic like the rest of the website</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Heuristics and Usability Test Comparison</h3>
<h4>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">While conducting the usability test with my friend Jessica, she was pleased with the amount of articles and topics displayed on the front homepage. She instantly began searching around for different articles, choosing to focus on the "Politics" tab as well as the "Archives" list. The browsing and search process went smoothly for her and she was interested in the articles she was able to find. However, problems arose while searching within the different time periods as the archived articles were not organized according to topic and instead layed out according to publication date. When it came to completing the second task, it only got more difficult as she could not find that many articles on WWII or the Vietnam War. Though she found some, there were almost nothing that documented student perspective on either of these conflicts. Compared to the heuristic review I conducted, Jessica was not put off by the crowded homepage and instead was intrigued by what the website had to offer. Her opinions and sentiments regarding the "Archives" list were an echo of my review, mentioning that you cannot search within the archived articles. Although there were some techinical concerns, she was still overall pleased with how the website performed and looked while she was browsing and searching.</p>
